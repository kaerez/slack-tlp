| Color  | When should it be used?   | How may it be shared?  |

| ![alt text][tlpred]  | Sources may use TLP:RED when information cannot be effectively acted upon by additional parties, and could lead to impacts on a party's privacy, reputation, or operations if misused.  |  Recipients may not share TLP:RED information with any parties outside of the specific exchange, meeting, or conversation in which it was originally disclosed. In the context of a meeting, for example, TLP:RED information is limited to those present at the meeting. In most circumstances, TLP:RED should be exchanged verbally or in person. |

Sources are at liberty to specify additional intended limits of the sharing: these must be adhered to. |
